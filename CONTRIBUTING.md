# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

How to contribute:
1. Fork the repository and create a branch for your change.
2. Run tests locally: `mvn test`
3. Make small, focused commits with descriptive messages.
4. Open a Pull Request (target: `main`) with a short description of the change and any relevant notes.

Style:
- Java 17 conventions
- Keep changes small and include unit tests where appropriate.

Code review:
- PRs should pass CI (build + tests + gitleaks) before merging.
